It is **very \nimportant** to choose damage classes based on strong proves only. Before launching into the task,\nstart by familiarising yourself with the ***Property Damage*** classes themselves. Visualise in your \nmind what each class option \u2018looks like\u2019 and why it is different to the other options. \n\n\n### Key points\n* Choose property damage class based on {color: green}**unequivocal evidence**{color} i.e.:\n\t- photos,\n  - videos,\n  - precise report text.\n* No need to make estimations and assumptions\n* If in doubt, choose a lower-magnitude option that you feel comfortable with\n* When analysing text, base on specific, reportive language, eg. {color: green}***\"There was shattered glass everywhere\"***{color}\n* Dont assign property damage class based on ambigous, emotive language, eg. {color: red}***\"OMG! It looked like a bombsite!\"***{color}\n\n### Property damage classes description\n\n\n1) ***No reference to building damage in source report or event description***\n\n   1. The source report has been comprehended in full and contains no relevant information to inform this assessment.\n   2. Either, damage to a building was simply not a factor in the incident (e.g. which was essentially non-violent), and therefore was not reported.\u00a0\n   3. The source report simply lacks detail on building damage, which may nonetheless have occurred e.g. \u201cthe extent of damages was not reported.\u201d\n\n2) ***No building damage [confirmed]***\n\n\t1. The source report itself rules out the occurrence of any damage to a building.\n\t2. Example: \u201c\u2026an IED detonated on the street without causing any damage\u201d.\n  \n 3) {color: lightblue}***Deface [building]***{color}\n \n\t1. Building or building feature sprayed with graffiti, paint, \u2018fake blood\u2019 or equivalent. \n\n\t2. Building plastered with stickers.\n\n\t3. Costs probably limited to cleaning or removal of graffiti etc. \u2013 closure of asset (e.g. business) likely to be very short-term.\n\n\t4. Should be selected as a default option where reporting refers generically to \u201cvandalism\u201d without specifying what actually occurred.\n\n\t5. **BUT NO** actual breaking of property (e.g. no smashing of windows), and no impact on the structural integrity of the building.\n\n4) {color: yellow}***Superficial damage [building]***{color}\n\t1. Features of building are actually damaged (i.e. broken, smashed), necessitating repairs or replacement. \n\n\t2. Exterior and interior features may be damaged (i.e. not just windows but furniture, balustrades, doors etc). \n\n\t3. Costs can range from minor (e.g. replacement of a broken window) to significant (e.g. if multiple assailants inflict damage throughout an asset).\n\n\t4. **BUT NO** impact on the structural integrity of the building\n  \n5) {color: yellow} ***Light fire damage [building]*** {color}\n\t1. Evidence of scorching around windows but that falls short of the gutting of floors\n\n\t2. Damage most likely to occur in incidents involving arson and incendiary Methods e.g. \u201cset on fire [building]; petrol bomb [throw at]\u201d.\n\n\t3. Cases where a building - or more likely a feature or part of a building - is known to have been set on fire or caught fire during a security incident, but where there is no evidence of heavy fire damage having occurred (likely because the fire was contained e.g. by emergency services).\n\n\t4. **BUT NO** impact on the structural integrity of the building.\n  \n6) {color: orange}***Heavy fire damage [building]***{color}\n\t1. Evidence of building clearly being consumed by flames during fire itself.\n\n\t2. Aftermath evidence of gutting of floors, extensive scorching and damage.\n\n\t3. Damage most likely to occur in incidents involving arson and incendiary Methods e.g. \u201cset on fire [building]; petrol bomb [throw at]\u201d.\n\n\t4. May result in partial or total building collapse \u2013 in which case \u201ccollapse [building]\u201d also applies.\n\n\t5. Reasonable to assume that costs will be significant \u2013 repair may even be impossible or not considered worthwhile.\n7) {color: red}***Collapse [building]***{color}\n\t1. Evidence of part or all of a building having collapsed, or some other indicator of structural failure.\n\n\t2. Likely to occur in major war, terrorist attack and civil unrest incidents \u2013 few incidents will reach this level in practice.\n\n\t3. Reasonable to assume that costs will be significant \u2013 repair may even be impossible or not considered worthwhile.\n  \n8) {color: grey}***Unknown type/other type of damage [building]\u201d***{color}\n\t1. There is enough information to conclude that some kind of material damage to a building occurred but not enough to specify which damage class.\n\n\t2. **DOES NOT COVER** damage to vehicles or other assets that are not buildings.\n  \n\n___\n  \n###\tMultiple incident report\n\nThe incident described in the event description actually refers to multiple incidents - [tick if this statement applies]\n\n* An incident is a geo-temporally **distinct** occurrence in which a specific actor or set of actors engages in a specific action or actions. \n\n* If an event description reports more than one of these combinations, then it is considered a multiple incident report. For example, if an event amalgamates multiple reports of the same action occurring but in distinct locations (even locations in different parts of the same city),  this option should be selected. The same would apply for a single report of multiple confrontations between the same actors but at different times (e.g. on different days).\n\n* Examples:\n\n\t* Spain:\u00a0In central Barcelona, several retail outlets were vandalised and looted during several nights of protests. [*multiple incident report* \u2013 these are separate incidents occurring at different points in time]\n  \n  * Bolivia: Road blocks were reported in six regional capitals - Santa Cruz, La Paz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, Tarija and Potos\u00ed - by opposition protesters who believe there was fraud in the 20 October re-election of President Evo Morales. [*multiple incident report* \u2013 multiple events across different locations]\n\n___\n\n### Additional sources used (response optional)\n\nPaste the URL of any additional source reports used to complete the modules; separate them with a semi-colon (;) is there more than one.\n\n___\n\n### Notes (response optional)\n\nUse these free-text field to record any additional information you think we should be aware of about this incident or the reporting of it.\n\n ", "options": {"formOptions": {"fullWidthFields": ["source_information_section", "source_information", "methods_section", "Methods_section", "Location_entity_section", "incident_location_description", "incident_location_focus", "location_entity_ID", "incident_spatial_relationship", "participant", "participants", "participants_number", "number_of_participants_numeric_approximation", "no_information_on_participants", "injuries", "injuries_numeric_approximation", "No_reference_to_injuries", "fatalities_numeric_approximation", "no_reference_to_injuries", "multiple_incident_report", "multiple_primary_event_incidents", "additional_sources_section", "additional_sources", "notes_section", "notes"], "boundingBoxFields": {}, "textAnnotationFields": []}}, "instanceTemplate": "\n## Source: {{[data.Source]}}\n___\n\n# Event description\n\n{{[data.Description]}}\n\n---\n\n## Event type: {{[result.primary_section.primary_event_type.0]}}\n## Country: {{[data.Country]}}\n## City: {{[data.City]}}\n## Occured: {{[data.Occurred]}}\n\n\n\n", "instanceSchemaTemplate": "{\n{{!-- *REMOVE THIS LINE TO USE THE EXAMPLE*\n\n  {{!
